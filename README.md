Romanian Reviews Dataset
Sentiment Analysis


# Datasets

1. [Movie and Products RO Reviews (ro_sent)](https://github.com/katakonst/sentiment-analysis-tensorflow)

2. [Products Ro Reviews (LaSoReDa)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laroseda)

# Results

1. Comparison between multiple types of models:
    1. Different training/validation datasets
    2. Different deep learning techniques (maybe some ML ones too (NB))
    3. Different word/text representations (ngram, w2v, d2v, tfidf, *wwv)
    4. Different sanitization/preprocessing methods
2. Plotting and visualisation of the models performance
   1. accuracy, precision, recall
   2. f1
   3. ROC AUC curves

# Goals

We propose a further inspection of the tasks presented by the datasets provided above. By combining the information and
using advanced deep learning techniques, we will develop a more performant model relative to the ones already made for
each of the tasks.
